# Disease_Prediction
The Repository contains a disease prediction model based on SVM algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset obtained from Kaggle. It can be used to predict the likelihood of a person having a particular disease based on their health report parameters.
This model predicts Diabetes and Parkinson's disease.
